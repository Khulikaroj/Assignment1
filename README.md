## Overview and Origin
 Quicken Loans is a non-bank mortgage lender based in Detroit, Michigan. The company, originally Rock Financial, was found in 1985 by Dan Gilbert, Ron Berman, Lindsay Gross, and Gary Gilbert. However, online mortgage lending business started when Intuit Inc., then a maker of an online lending platform called QuickenMortgage, bought the company in 1999.

Unlike traditional banks, Quicken Loans relies on wholesale funding and make loans over online application rather than over office branches. The business model was developed since late 1990s.

Moreover, Quicken Loans was the first non-bank lender who offer mortgage loans across the country back when business was very fragmented by states from different law and regulation in mortgage and housing markets.
